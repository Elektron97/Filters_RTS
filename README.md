# Filters_RTS
Real Time System Project: Simulate Filters with pthread library.

Trace: Simulate N filters of different types (e.g., low-pass, high-pass, and band-pass) selectable by
the user. All filters receive the same input signal and produce different outputs. The input signal is
generated by a periodic task and is also selectable from a given set (e.g., sinusoidal, square,
sawtooth, step, square, and triangular).
