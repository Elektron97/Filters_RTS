# Filters_RTS
Real Time System Project 2019/2020: Simulate Filters with **pthread library**.
Author: Daniele Caradonna.

**Trace**: Simulate N filters of different types (e.g., low-pass, high-pass, and band-pass) selectable by the user. All filters receive the same input signal and produce different outputs. The input signal is generated by a periodic task and is also selectable from a given set (e.g., sinusoidal, square, sawtooth, step, square, and triangular).

**TO DO:**
- FFT moving window
- Chirp (opzionale)

### Note to compile and run
- **To compile**: `make`
- **To run**: `sudo ./filters`
