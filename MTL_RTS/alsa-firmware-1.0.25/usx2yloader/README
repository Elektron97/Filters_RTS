GENERAL
=======

This directory contains the firmware data files for usx2yloader
utility in alsa-tools package.  Install this with the same prefix
option as you used for alsa-tools.

BUILDING FIRMWARE FROM SOURCE
=============================

Building the firmware from source is possible, if you use the 
configure option --enable-buildfw. Also, it requires the 8031/8051
cross-assembler as31. As31 version 2.3.0 is fine for this job, but 
every version since 2.2 should do it.

As31 is available from:
http://wiki.erazor-zone.de/doku.php?id=wiki:projects:linux:as31

At the moment it's only possible to build tascam_loader.ihx from 
source.
